# Quiz Template Guide

This folder contains a `template.html` file that all teammates should use to create their quiz pages.

## How to Create Your Quiz Page

1. Copy `template.html` and rename it to your quiz name, e.g., `quiz1.html`.
2. Update the `<title>` tag and `<h1>` tag with your quiz topic.
3. Replace the question and answer buttons with your own.
4. Save your file and push it to the GitHub repository.

## Example Usage

- `quiz1.html` → Multiple Choice Quiz
- `quiz2.html` → Fill in the Blank Quiz
- `quiz3.html` → True/False Quiz

All quizzes will automatically include the **navbar and footer**, so no extra setup is needed!
