## report part one notes by Manik Khadiya.40652166 for SET0801

into 
summarry
research
features of our site
what im responsibele for 
waht i plan to do
wireframes



Report criteria/gc chat log: 

discuss team members strengths and weaknesses and encourage them to work on thier weaknesses though mainly on thier strength to mitigate time wasteage and inefficiency

how are we going about implementing this though?

Also my only concern is that this could be too easy?

What are your opinions?

When shall we get onto canvas and map out how our site would be interacted with or has this alr been done?

Wireframes should be discussed Maybe a feature for accessibility? I would be down to develop that that would and can be integrated into each page easily For additional marks

for a 1st we should look into APIs if resources allow

Note: I've alr set up a repo on github pages, so we can use that though I'll need emails to add contributers to it When talking about how we're making this
I think we should take a RAD approach and look at stages of dev and sprints to make a framework to easily be able to add more on top of what we've made this will allow more conversation
if we deviate from the original idea

Also we should discuss team roles and if we are going ahead with or without them itll be another thing we can discuss in pt2

Cont. Points for report: 

evaluate why the idea is fun Maybe talk about what is 'fun' in this context for clarity.

Evaluate how we will develop a satisfying user experience and how we will utilise a visually pleasing design, and how we have considered how the users will interact with the site.

Give summary of overall site design Detail feature(s) that you are responsible for

Discuss how we are staying within time constraints (gantt chart?, scrum board?, kanbanboard?, projects @ github?)

Describe core plan with minimum spec

Discuss supplementary features on stop of core

Must include following: 
Summary
Credit to inspiration where due (sporcle)
Evaluation of planned features
Site tree and organisation Wireframes
Project plan for organisation (gantt) Inc, personal plan. 
 
The first part of the assignment is a report which will focus on the features, analysis, design, and plan for implementation of your site & is worth 40% of the total mark. The second part of the assignment is the implementation and deployment of your design and is worth 60%. It is expected that what you design might deviate from your final implementation and that techniques you discover later in the module might cause you to re-think or re-approach decisions you have already made. You might discover that your initial idea needs to be completely replaced with something more achievable. This is fine and gives you an opportunity for critical reflection in your final report. Above all, this coursework should be fun, so use your imagination, and give your creativity a free rein. Invention and originality will be rewarded by the marking scheme 

Your report must include the following: 
1. A description of the overall site that your group is planning with enough background context for your reader to understand what you are trying to do. 
2. A summary of any background research into other similar sites, or useful technologies, libraries, or APIs that you have individually investigated with a description of how this has contributed to your group’s project idea and design. This can be related to the group’s site as a whole as well as for the specific feature you are responsible for in the group. 
3. A list of the features/functionality in the group’s overall site and some discussion of why each is included. A clear description and discussion of the feature/functionality you will be responsible for in the group is required. 
4. Site organisation and/or navigation tree diagrams with associated discussion and explanation of how your group plans to organise the pages that make up the site and how a user might typically navigate through those pages. Your diagrams can be combined if that is a useful way to present the organisation and navigation for your site. These diagrams may be hand-drawn and scanned/photographed, or created using any image/diagram software as you think fit. The diagrams and explanation you provide must include the specific feature/functionality you are responsible for, but they can also address site as a whole. 
5. A sketch/wireframe/low/mid/high-fidelity prototype of an initial user interface for your group’s site and some commentary on the motivation for your design, i.e. how does your design address the feature/functionality for which you are responsible? You only need to include the design of the features/functionality that you are responsible for, but if you choose to include design for the whole site make sure you attribute the design to the correct individuals in your team. If your designs are hand-drawn then they can be scanned/photographed for inclusion in your report. 
6. A project plan that demonstrates how you will organise your effort and time to achieve your goals. This plan can be presented in any appropriate form, e.g. a list of dates and tasks, a gantt chart, and/or a narrative description. It should include your personal plan to complete what you are responsible and an overall group plan. The group plan can be less detailed, but should give an indication that as a group you have discussed appropriate target completion dates for all parts of the project. 
7. (Optional) As appropriate: any additional sections that you deem fit to describe your group’s project, with specific attention paid to the features/functionality you are responsible for. For example, if you have decided to implement a particular feature as an extension to the core requirements then this would be the place to report on it. Similarly if you intend to save data within the browser, then some description of the kinds of data that you intend to store, how you will store it, and how it will be structured, should be reported on.
